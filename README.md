Custom Slides Template to start from for presentations 

**FIXME** Citations are not coloured when it comes to pages and additional
arguments for the `\citet{}` command. Workaround done, but not nice.
**FIXME** There is a bit of a mess in the way the template works, tidy up.
**FIXME** There is an issue with the lists not working as in the layout for
drafts.

**Changes**: itemize/enumerate with primary and secondary colour instead of
normal text colour.
